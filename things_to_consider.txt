Things to consider:

When contracts have attached tiles, where do they come from?
	a. a pre-existing collection no one is allowed to purchase
	b. a dynamically chosen tile that no one owns that fits the bill
	
How do we filter contracts in the contract_templates_controller so that 
	players get the right one?
	a. player type
	b. requirements compared to player capability?
	c. difficulty / points vs. points_required_to_unlock? 
	
	

How do we know things are working out?
On our end:
- Are they able to clearly articulate where the project stands, including what part of last week's 
	plan worked, and what needs to be done for the upcoming week?
- Are they able to translate ideas from the lab meetings into a technical plan?
- Are they comfortable asking clarification questions during week?
- Are they comfortable generating simple examples of UI when there's no firm plan yet 
	(so, "We want to implement political capital, but we don't know yet the best way to show the user.")
- Do they put good code, harmonious relationships, and student growth ahead of time to deployment?
- Do they delegate to students in a reasonable way (some challenges, a reasonable amount of work)?

On their end:
- Do they feel like their voice is heard?
- Do they feel like we're articulating what our expectations and wants are?
