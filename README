Notes on world ticking:

* config/schedule.rb runs on deploy to installs two Cron jobs. TurnScheduler#mark_for_processing, and #turn_next_world
* each world tick is handled by Jobs::WorldTurner#turn_a_world which queues up a bunch of beanstalk jobs to be processed by stalker processes.
* WorldTurn (not -er) encapsulates logic for a single turn.
